## :telescope: Overview

**svc-scheduler** is responsible for scheduling, confirming and canceling flights. 
The service exposes two crates:
- server - [bin] target to run gRPC server
- client - [lib] target for other services to import and use

Directory:
- `server/src`: Source Code and Unit Tests for scheduler-service server
- `client-grpc/src`: Source Code for scheduler-service client
- `proto/`: Types used for gRPC messaging
- `client/tests/`: Integration Tests
- `docs/`: Module Documentation

## Installation

Install Rust with [Rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

```bash
# Adds custom pre-commit hooks to .git through cargo-husky dependency
# !! Required for developers !!
cargo test
```

## Make

### Build and Test

To ensure consistent build and test outputs, Arrow provides a Docker image with all required software installed to build and test Rust projects.
Using the Makefile, you can easily test and build your code.

```bash
# Build Locally
make rust-build

# Create Deployment Container
make build

# Run Deployment Container
make docker-run

# Stopping Deployment Container
make docker-stop

# Running examples (uses docker compose file)
make rust-example-grpc
```

### Formatting

The Arrow docker image has some formatting tools installed which can fix your
code formatting for you. Using the Makefile, you can easily run the formatters
on your code. Make sure to commit your code before running these commands, as
they might not always result in the desired outcome.

```bash
# Format TOML files
make toml-tidy

# Format Rust files
make rust-tidy

# Format Python files
make python-tidy

# Format all at once
make tidy
```

### Spell check

Before being able to commit, cspell will be used as a spelling checker for all files, making sure no unintended spelling errors are found.
You can run cspell yourself by using the following make target:
```bash
make cspell-test
```

If all spelling errors are fixed, but cspell still finds words that are unknown, you can add these words to the local project words list by running the following command:
```bash
make cspell-add-words
```

### Other `make` Targets

There are additional make targets available. You can find all possible targets by running make without a target or use `make help`

## Debugging

All unit tests start with initialization of the logger, allowing for easier
debugging when tests are failing.
Since the log files are written as json, it's easy to search for log messages
using [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/).
You can adjust the log level in the `log4rs.yaml` config file if needed.

Example `jq` query, to get all messages generated by the router when running
`test_query_flight_9_deadhead_destination_flight_no_capacity_at_destination_vertiport`:

```bash
cat server/logs/router.log | jq -c '. | select(.thread=="grpc::queries::tests::test_query_flight_9_deadhead_destination_flight_no_capacity_at_destination_vertiport") | .message'
```

Additionally, you could grep on the function name you want to track the log
output for:
```bash
cat server/logs/router.log | jq -c '. | select(.thread=="grpc::queries::tests::test_query_flight_9_deadhead_destination_flight_no_capacity_at_destination_vertiport") | .message' | grep 'get_possible_flights'
```

### Get all logs for a specific test
It is also possible to find all log messages generated by a specific test. For
this, you first need to find the thread_id:

```bash
cat server/logs/tests.log | jq -c '. | { message: .message, thread_id: .thread_id, date: .time}' | grep 'test_query_flight_9'
```

You can then use this thread_id (without quotes!) to find all messages in all log files generated
by this thread:

```bash
cat server/logs/*.log | jq -c '[.] | sort_by(.time) | .[] | select(.thread_id==<insert_your_thread_id>) | .message'
```

## :exclamation: Treatment of `Cargo.lock`
If you are building a non-end product like a library, include `Cargo.lock` in `.gitignore`.

If you are building an end product like a command line tool, check `Cargo.lock` to the git.
